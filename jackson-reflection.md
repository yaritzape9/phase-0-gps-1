#Reflection GPS 1.1

## Joe Jackson

* Prior struggles:

>Before this I was not sure on why old branches hung around after the merge.

* Clarified concepts:

>I feel like I understand the entire Git workflow better, not just the how, but the why of it.

* Asked questions:

>I asked the guide about my dev environment mostly. I relied on my pair to explain the merge process in detail

* Current struggles

>The not direct relationship between Git and GitHub. After I delete a merged branch on GitHub, I still have it on Git. I have been working around this by deleting and cloning after merges. I do not think that this is correct.

* How was it?

>Enlightening. My pair was great, cooperative and supportive. I feel that we switched easily between driver and navigator and worked through the issues together well. I think that the work load was well ballanced.
