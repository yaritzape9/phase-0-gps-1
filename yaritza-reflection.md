# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	It took me a while to get in the habit of making branches and adding and commiting.

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	I am a bit more comfortable with anding and commiting, and also pushing files to github.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	How we should go about certain ideas we were thinking of. Also how git init works and when the message reinitializing comes up that means that we already git init it. 

# What still confuses you about Git?
	The merging and making folders. Also when to make a new branch.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	It was a nice expierence meeting my pair. I wouldve loved a more hands on apporach but I atleast tried the hands off approach. The pair work was fun and we actually paired up after to finish the task which I thought was cool!
